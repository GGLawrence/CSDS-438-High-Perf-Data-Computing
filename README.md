CSDS491 AI: Probabilistic Graphical Models

High performance data and computing (HPDC) leverages parallel processing in order to maximize speed and throughput. This hands-on course will cover theoretical and practical aspects of HPDC. Theoretical concepts covered include computer architecture, parallel programming, and performance optimization. Practical applications will be discussed from various information and scientific fields. Practical considerations will include HPDC job management and Unix scripting. Weekly assessments and a course project will be required.
